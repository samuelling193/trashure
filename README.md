Challenges and next release Features

One of the main challenges the Team faced with the project is being able to obtain information from a 3d party API, manipulatianig with geodata, storing these data in DB

For Future releases some extra features can be added:

 - Search option so User can sort all available in DB items by certain criteria
 - Email notifications with details of reservation can be sent to the User who posted the Item and to the User who reserved the Item 
 - Integrate third party API to improve UX uploading images (e.g. use Cloudinary)
